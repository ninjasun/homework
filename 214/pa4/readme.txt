Our design for this assignment was to store the words in a linked list and each node has it's own linked list. We choose this data structure because it makes inserting and removing nodes easier. Once the main data structure is built our SA and SO duplicate the nodes it needs first and store it in a temp data structure. This way we don't risk inserting or removing something from the main data structure.

For this assignment we used the Indexer that was provided. Our indexer had a few bugs that we hope to fix soon.
