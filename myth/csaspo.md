Myth:
  Anything which is told, recieved, and transmitted in the convinction of its
  social importance

Ideology:
  A set of beliefs characteristic of a social group


Malinowski and the Tobriand Islanders:
- Studied culture of islands located northeast of New Guinea
- Believed that myth is "living reality" rather than just stories explaining
  origins
- Had little use for abstract or symbolic theories regarding the function of
  myth (i.e., Jung, Freud, Cambell) or for conclusions based on textual study
  alone (i.e., Levi-Strauss)


General Ideology  : Freedom = truly; slavery = animal
Subgroup Ideology :
  Aristocrats
  * Anyone who works is little better than a slave
  * Free = leisure for education, games

  Wage Laborers
  * Aristrocratic freedom = social parasites
  * Honor = industry, enterprise = freedom from want

Myth will be acceptable to both classes, but will subtly show preference for
one ideological view over another, imposing this perspective on society at
large.
