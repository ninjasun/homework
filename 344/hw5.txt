Using the Select algorithm shown in class, we can find the median in O(n) time.
We can then use the Partitioning algorithm from quicksort that we went over in 
class to put the median in place and have all elements greater than it to the 
right, and all elements less than or equal to it on the left in O(n) time.
We then iterate through the list and count the number of values equal to the 
median. For the mode to appear at least n/2 times, this number must be greater
than or equal to n/2. This takes n time.
