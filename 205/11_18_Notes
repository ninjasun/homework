Equivalent relation R over set A is:
	(r)reflexive
	(r)symmetric
	(r)transitive

Equivalent class of a exists in A: {b | (a,b) exists in R}

Partition of set A:
	collection of sets B(sub i) such that the union of all sets B(sub i) = A

If R is an equivalent relation over A, then
	i.) aRb
	ii.) [a]=[b]
	iii.) [a]union[b] =/= 0 (empty set)

	(i) iff (ii) iff (iii)

Theorm trans_closure
tc(R) must be (i) Transitive
			  (ii) contain R
			  (iii)"minimal" if S' is a transitive rel containing R,
			  		then tc(R) is a subset of S'
