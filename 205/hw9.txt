1.)
//Let ^ be the empty string
A = 8
B = (9 | ^)
C = 8*
D = 9

8989:
	This is in the language of the expression, becase it can be represented as a combination of A,B,C, and D.
	A -> 8
	B -> 9
	C -> 8
	D -> 9
	=8989

889:
	This is in the language of the expression, becase it can be represented as a combination of A,B,C, and D.
	A -> 8
	B -> ^
	C -> 8
	D -> 9
	=889

989:
	This is not in the language of the expression, because the first character
	must be an 8.

89:
	This is in the language of the expression, becase it can be represented as a combination of A,B,C, and D.
	A -> 8
	B -> ^
	C -> ^
	D -> 9
	=89
	
2.)
	a.) a*(baa)*
	b.) a*(ba*b)*a*


3.) 
	a.)
		RTP: R* = R*R*
		lhs = R*
		rhs = R*R*
		rhs = (empty string)R* 		pick an empty string for the first R*
		rhs = R*					because empty string plus another string is the other string
		lhs = rhs					QED
	
	b.) False
		Counter-example:
		"R" is in the language of the rhs
		"R" is not in language of the lhs
		Thus, the lhs != rhs because their languages do express the same strings.
