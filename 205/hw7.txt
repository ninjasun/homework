1.) Which of the assertion(s) named (A thru G) are the "loop invariant".
2.) Discover the loop invariant that will ensure that G implies POST
3.) List the actual assertions besides each of the names below:

 Assertion     Formula
   PRE              n>=0
   A				k<=n  

   B				y=0

   C				k!=n, n>0

   C'				k<n

   D				y= sum from i=0 to k-1 (1+2i)

   E				first=1+2k

   F				k<=n

   G				y= sum from k=0 to n-1 (1+2k)

   POST           y=n*n

Loop invariant: k<=n; y= sum from i=0 to k-1 (1+2i)
Assertion D is the loop invariant
